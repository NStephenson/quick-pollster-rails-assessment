## About

## Getting Started

*Note: This assumes you have Ruby 2.2.3 or later installed properly and have a basic working knowledge of how to use RubyGems*

First, fork and clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NStephenson/quick-pollster-rails-assessment.git
```

Then setup dependencies using bundler

```bash
bundle install
```

Now create the database

```bash
rake db:migrate
```

Next, to allow the users to authorize accounts using facebook, create a file in the root of the directory named `.env`

```bash
touch .env
```

Then inside your .env place your facebook key and secret as follows. Instruction on how to obtain a key and ID can be found at http://developers.facebook.com

```
FACEBOOK_KEY = 'YOUR KEY'
FACEBOOK_SECRET = 'YOUR SECRET'
```

Now you are ready to run your server.

```bash
rails s
